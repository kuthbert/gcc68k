GCC 68k Binaries for Windows

---


Contains GCC 3.4.2 Windows Binaries (includes cygwin) for cross compiling code for the Freescale 68000. Also contains a locator and translator to convert Motorola syntax into SGS syntax (not 100% complete, but it's easy to add more conversions). With SGS syntax the resulting .asm file can be run in Easy68k.
